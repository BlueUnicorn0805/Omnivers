<h2>National Funding Group, LLC. PAYMENT PROCESSING AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>This National Funding Group, LLC. Payment Processing Agreement (“<b>Agreement</b>”) is a legal agreement between National Funding Group, LLC. (“<b>Halo Pay</b>”) and the person or entity (“<b>you</b>”, “<b>your</b>”, or “<b>user</b>”) who registered for any account to receive payment processing and other business services as are offered by Halo Pay and its affiliates (the “<b>Services</b>”).</p>
<p>You may not use or access the Services unless you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>1.  General.</h3>
<p>Halo Pay provides the various platforms, including [CURRENT PLATFORM] (the “<b>Platform</b>”) the ability to process payments between merchants and customers on the Platform. Halo Pay will process payments made to you based on instructions provided to Halo Pay by the Platform. You may have a separate agreement with the Platforms (“<b>Platform Agreement</b>”) for the Platform to provide you with various services (“<b>Platform Services</b>”). You should read your Platform Agreement carefully to understand the nature of the Platform Services and the actions that a Platform may conduct on your behalf with regard to the Services.</p>

<h3>2.  Your Account.</h3>
<p>Only businesses and other entities or persons located in the United States are eligible to apply for an account and use the Services. To register for an account, you or the person submitting the application (your “<b>Representative</b>”) must provide Halo Pay with your business or trade name, physical address, email, phone number, tax identification number, URL, the nature of your business or activities, bank account information, other information necessary for ACH processing, and certain other information about you that we require. Halo Pay may also collect personal information (including name, birthdate, and government-issued identification number) about your beneficial owners, principals, and your account administrator.</p>
<p>Until you have submitted, and we have reviewed and approved, all required information, your account will be available to you on a preliminary basis only, and we may terminate it at any time and for any reason.</p>
<p>You may only use the Services to facilitate transactions with your customers and not to send money, conduct personal transactions, or for any other purpose prohibited by this Agreement.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><u>Representative</u>. You and your Representative represent and warrant to Halo Pay that (i) you and your Representative are at least <b>18 years of age</b>(ii) your Representative is authorized to provide information to Halo Pay on your behalf and bind you to this Agreement, and (iii) your Representative is an officer, manager, or otherwise has significant control over your business.</li>
    <li><u>Access to Your Information</u>. You authorize Halo Pay to access and receive information about you from affiliates and third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which may include your name, addresses, credit history and other information about you.</li>
    <li><u>Updating Your Account</u>. You agree to update the information in your account promptly when any changes occur.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3.  Your Customers.</h3>
<p>Halo Pay is not responsible for your relationship with your customers or the goods and services you offer or sell. You agree that you are solely responsible for the nature and quality of the goods and services you provide and for delivery, support, refunds, returns, and any other ancillary services you provide to your customers.</p>
<p>You are responsible for determining whether a purchase, sale, order, or other transaction (“<b>Transaction</b>”) is accurate, complete, or typical for your business. As such, you must determine whether an initiated Transaction is erroneous, suspicious, or fraudulent. You are solely responsible for any losses incurred due to erroneous or fraudulent Transactions in connection with your use of the Services.</p>
<p>You are responsible for providing your customers with support regarding Transaction receipts, delivery, returns, refunds, and any other issues related to your goods or services and business. </p>

<h3>4.  Your Obligations.</h3>
<p>You are solely responsible for, and Halo Pay disclaims all liability for, the provisions of any goods or services sold to your customers as part of your use of the Services, and any other obligations you may owe your customers. </p>
<p>You are always financially liable to Halo Pay for disputes, refunds, returns, and reversals that arise from your use of the Services.</p>

<h3>5.  Relationship to Platform.</h3>
<p>You understand and agree that Halo Pay and the Platform may share your information and data in order to facilitate your use of the Services. When Halo Pay receives your information and data, Halo Pay may use such information and data in accordance with the Halo Pay Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, which are incorporated into this Agreement in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p>The pricing for your use of the Services will include the fees specified in this Agreement and any fees charged to you by the Platform. Halo Pay does not control and is not responsible for the fees charged by the Platform to you. Halo Pay will have the right to deduct from your account balance both Halo Pay’s and the Platform’s fees.</p>

<h3>6.	Payment Processing Services.</h3>
<p>Halo Pay works with the Platform to provide you with the Services in two ways: through the Automated Clearinghouse to an account that your customer maintains with a bank or other financial institution (“<b>ACH</b>”) or through payment via any remaining balance on the customer’s personal Halo Pay account (the “<b>Halo Pay Balance</b>”). Where the Services enable you to submit Automated Clearinghouse (“<b>ACH</b>”) instructions to capture funds from an account that your customer maintains with a bank or other financial institution in connection with a Transaction (a “<b>Charge</b>”), Halo Pay may limit or refuse to process any Charge for any Restricted Business (as defined below), or for Charges submitted in violation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>You may only submit Charges through the Services that are authorized by your customers. To enable Halo Pay to process Transactions for you, you authorize and direct Halo Pay, it affiliates, and the applicable financial institution to receive and settle any payment processing proceeds owed to you through the Services. You hereby appoint Halo Pay as your agent for the purpose of directing, receiving, holding, and settling such proceeds. You agree that Halo Pay’s receipt of such proceeds satisfies the relevant customer’s obligations to make payment to you.</p>
<p>You maintain the direct relationship with your customers and are responsible for acquiring all appropriate consent to submit a Charge on their behalf, provide confirmation or receipts to customers for a Charge, verify the customers identity, and determine the customer’s eligibility and authority to complete a Transaction. Halo Pay is not responsible for or liable to you for authorized or completed Charges that are later subject to a customer dispute, refund, return, or reversal.</p>
<p>You are responsible to Halo Pay for all disputes, refunds, returns, or reversals regardless of reason or timing. Halo Pay may decline to act upon a refund instruction if it would cause your account balance to become negative, you are subject to bankruptcy proceedings, or Halo Pay believes there is a risk you will not satisfy your liabilities under this Agreement.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><u>Automated Clearinghouse</u>. The ACH network is controlled and managed by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (“<b>NACHA</b>”) and its member organizations. Where submitting Charges over the ACH network, you are required to comply with the NACHA Operating Rules. NACHA may amend the NACHA Operating Rules at any time, and we may amend this Agreement or make changes to the Services as necessary to comply with the NACHA Operating Rules.
        You understand and accept your role as the Originator (as defined in the NACHA Operating Rules). You agree to obtain your customer’s consent to debit or credit their bank account and initiate a Charge over the ACH network. Such consent must be in a form and manner that complies with the NACHA Operating Rules and the documentation for ACH Transactions. You may not and may not attempt to send or receive funds to or from a person, entity, or state where such Transactions are prohibited by applicable law. You also agree to maintain the security and integrity of all information you collect as part of an ACH Transaction.
        Any disputes or unauthorized Charges using the ACH network may result in you becoming unable to accept ACH payments.
    </li>
    <li><u>Disputes, Refunds, and Reversals</u>. Payments may be invalidated and reversed by Halo Pay if, among other reasons, the funding transaction is declined or reversed, the payment was unauthorized or unfunded, or if the payment was for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement with us.
        As the recipient of a Charge that is later invalidated for any reason, you may be liable to Halo Pay for the full amount of the Charge and Halo Pay may recover the amount of the Charge (plus any fees) from you.
        When recovering the amount of an invalidated Charge from you, Halo Pay may apply any money sent to you via the Services, request that you add money to your account for the amount of the Charge and apply that money to amounts owed, and Halo Pay may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you and place a limitation or take other action with regard to your account.
    </li>
    <li><u>Security Interest</u>. You grant Halo Pay a lien and security interest in all funds for Transactions processed for your, including funds deposited in your account, as well as funds held in any other bank account to which Transaction funds are deposited or transferred. Upon Halo Pay’s request, you will execute any documents and pay any fees Halo Pay considers necessary to create, perfect, and maintain a security interest in such funds, including, without limitation, the filing of a form UCC-1.</li>
</ol>

<h3>7.	Fees and Taxes.</h3>
<p>Halo Pay will provide you the Services at the rates and for the fees (“<b>Fees</b>”) described below. Halo Pay may revise the Fees at any time but will provide you at lease 30 days prior notice before such revisions become effective (or such longer period as required by applicable law).</p>
<p><pre>Per Transaction Fee:     3% plus $0.25</pre>
<p>If you provide Halo Pay with validation of your current lowest transaction fee as provided to you by a major credit card servicer (the “<b>Documented Transaction Fee</b>”), Halo Pay will reduce your per Transaction fee to 50% of such Documented Transaction Fee. You agree to provide Halo Pay all requested information in order to validate your Documented Transaction Fee.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the payment of all taxes, customs, duties, fees, and other charges imposed by any governmental authority (“<b>Taxes</b>”) on the Services provided under this Agreement. You are solely responsible for assessing, collecting, reporting, and remitting all applicable Taxes on the Services provided under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>14.	Confidentiality.</h3>
<ol type="a">
    <li><u>Confidential Information</u>. In connection with this Agreement, Halo Pay may disclose or make available Confidential Information to you. Subject to Section 14, “<b>Confidential Information</b>” means information in any form or medium (whether oral, written, electronic, or other) that Halo Pay considers confidential or proprietary, including information consisting of or relating to Halo Pay’ technology, trade secrets, know-how, business operations, plans, strategies, customers, and pricing, and information with respect to which Halo Pay has contractual or other confidentiality obligations, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified as “confidential.” </li>
    <li><u>Exclusion</u>. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) was rightfully known to you without restriction on use or disclosure prior to such information being disclosed or made available to you in connection with this Agreement; (ii) was or becomes generally known by the public other than by you or any of your representatives’ noncompliance with this Agreement; (iii) was or is received by you on a non-confidential basis from a third party that was not or is not, at the time of such receipt, under any obligation to maintain its confidentiality; (iv) was or is independently developed by you without reference to or use of any Confidential Information or (v) is deemed to be residual information as provided in section 14(e) below.</li>

            <li>not access or use Confidential Information other than as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement;</li>
            <li>except as may be permitted under the terms and conditions of section 14(d), not disclose or permit access to Confidential Information other than to your representatives who: (i) need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of your exercise of your rights or performance of your obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and you obligations under this section; and (iii) are bound by confidentiality and restricted use obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms set forth in this section;</li>
            <li>safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure using at least the degree of care you use to protect your most sensitive information and in no event less than a reasonable degree of care;</li>
            <li>promptly notify Halo Pay of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information and take all reasonable steps to prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure; and</li>
            <li>ensure your representatives’ compliance with, and be responsible and liable for any of your representatives’ non-compliance with, the terms of this section.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, your obligations under this section with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under any applicable law will continue until such time, if ever, as such Confidential Information ceases to qualify for trade secret protection under one or more such applicable laws other than as a result of any act or omission of you or any of your representatives.</p>

</ol>

<h3>15.	Dispute Resolution.</h3>

<ol type="a">
    <li><u>Binding Arbitration</u>. In the event that there is a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to statutory or common law claims, the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of any provision of this Agreement, and the determination of the scope or applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy originating from this Agreement, but specifically excluding any dispute principally related to either party’s intellectual property (which such dispute will be resolved in litigation before the federal and state courts for the State of Colorado), will be determined by arbitration in Denver, Colorado before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The Expedited Procedures of the American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply for cases in which no disclosed claim or counterclaim exceeds $75,000 (exclusive of interest, attorneys’ fees and arbitration fees and costs). Where no party’s claim exceeds $25,000 (exclusive of interest, attorneys’ fees and arbitration fees and costs), and in other cases in which the parties agree, Section E-6 of the Expedited Procedures of the American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the State of Colorado, exclusive of its conflict or choice of law rules. If the American Arbitration Association is no longer in business, or refuses or declines to administer any dispute between the parties brought before it, either party may petition the federal and state courts for the State of Colorado to appoint the arbitrator. Nothing in this paragraph will preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provisions in this paragraph referencing applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) will govern any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
        Either party may commence arbitration by providing to the American Arbitration Association and the other party to the dispute a written demand for arbitration, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested.
    </li>
    <li><u>Service of Process</u>. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.</li>
    <li><u>Class Waiver</u>. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the parties agrees that any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated between the parties.</li>
    <li><u>Provision of an Award</u>: Subject to the limitations of liability identified in this Agreement, the appointed arbitrators may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of the State of Colorado. In making a determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term or provision of this Agreement. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned written decision with respect to the dispute (the “Award”) to each party, who will promptly act in accordance with the Award. Any Award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed in or enforced by a state or federal court located in Denver, Colorado. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties and will not be subject to appeal or review.</li>
    <li><u>Fees</u>. Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, the costs of the attendance of the arbitration reporter at the arbitration hearing, and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.</li>
    <li><u>Confidentiality</u>. The parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the Award, except (i) as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, (ii) in connection with a court application as contemplated above for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an Award or its enforcement, (iii) our disclosure of the Award in confidential settlement negotiations, or (iv) as otherwise required by applicable laws. The parties, witnesses, and arbitrator will treat as confidential and will not disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration hereunder, except as required by law or except if such evidence was obtained from the public domain or was otherwise obtained independently from the arbitration.</li>
</ol>

    <li><u>Force Majeure</u>. Except with respect to your payment obligation under this Agreement, neither party will be liable for delays in processing or nonperformance caused by telecommunication, utility, or equipment failures, labor conflicts, riots, war, terrorist attacks, nonperformance of our vendors or suppliers, fires, earthquakes, or other acts of nature, or any other event which is outside the reasonable control of a party.</li>
    <li><u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Halo Pay for provision and use of the Services. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over conflicting terms in any other agreement with respect to the Services.</li>

The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that party’s rights to subsequently enforce the provision.</li>

A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email, or other means of electronic transmission is deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.</li>
